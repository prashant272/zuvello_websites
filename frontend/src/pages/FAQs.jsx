            question: "Are your soft toys safe for babies?",
            answer: "Yes! All Zuvello soft toys are thoroughly tested to meet and exceed global safety standards. We use non-toxic, hypoallergenic materials, and our toys are free from small detachable parts that could pose a choking hazard."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I wash my Zuvello plushie?",
            answer: "Most of our toys are machine washable on a gentle, cold cycle. We recommend placing them in a pillowcase or laundry bag for extra protection. Let them air dry completely. For extra fluffy toys, a quick brush after drying will restore their softness."
        },
        {
            question: "Do you offer international shipping?",
            answer: "Currently, we ship across all major cities and towns in India. We are working hard to bring Zuvello hugs to the rest of the world very soon!"
        },
        {
            question: "Can I include a gift message?",
            answer: "Absolutely! During checkout, you will have the option to add a personalized gift message, which we will print on a beautiful card and include with your package."
        },
        {
            question: "What if I receive a damaged product?",
            answer: "We take extreme care in packaging, but if your new friend arrives hurt, please contact us within 48 hours of delivery at zuvello@gmail.com with photos, and we will arrange a free replacement immediately."
